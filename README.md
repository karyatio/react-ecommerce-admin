# Project TODO :

## creating a single state for pending/loading/waiting

[x] This app use a lot of pending/waiting/loading condition, and every waiting/loading has it own
action types. since all pending/waiting/loading condition is similar, consider refactoring code
to use only 1 action for pending/waiting/loading

## Combine addProduct, editProduct, getProduct, deleteProduct action and reducer

## Refactor plz

[] components/Products/ProductForm seperate create and edit but use the same component for form
